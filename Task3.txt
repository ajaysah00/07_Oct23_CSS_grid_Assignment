
  Explain the use of grid-auto-row and grid-auto-column using code examples.
    Ans: 1.The use of grid-auto-row are: 
       grid-auto-row is used to define the properties of implicitly generated rows in a grid container. These rows are created when grid items are placed in rows that don't exist explicitly in the grid.
You can use this property to set properties like size, alignment, and more for these implicitly created rows.
   

  The use of grid-auto-column are: 
        Similarly, grid-auto-column is used to define the properties of implicitly generated columns in a grid container. These columns are created when grid items are placed in columns that don't exist explicitly in the grid.



        Here is some code:

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; 
  grid-auto-rows: 100px; 
}

.grid-item {
 
  grid-row: 1;
  grid-column: 1;
}


.grid-container{
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr; 
  grid-auto-columns: 150px;
 }

 .grid-item {
  grid-row: 1;
  grid-column: 1;
}
